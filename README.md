# Analyzing Job Sectors?

Link to [project demo](<URL>)

In this PowerBI study, we will explore the U.S. job market dataset to uncover insights in particularly these four sectors: Healthcare & Education, Professional, Scientific & Management, and Administrative & Waste Management Services, Public Administration, and lastly Manufacturing. We will use Power Query to dive deeper into each of these sectors and explore their wages and other meaningful insights. Before loading the data into Power Query, we will use Python to clean some data types to ensure a smooth workflow process. Ultimately we will use PowerBI to create a dashboard to explore these sectors to show trends, patterns, and key insights such as wage distributions, employment growth, and sector specfic-factors. It will also provide users to gain a deeper understanding of how these sectors contribute to the U.S. ecnomony and highlight some disparities and opportunities. This will provide decision-makers with actionable insights for strategic planning, policy-making, and workforce development.
